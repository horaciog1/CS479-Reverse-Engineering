For this crack-me I used the `strings easy_crackme_1` command from linux to extract the strings from the executable. I usually use this command before starting to reverse engineer since there exists a posibility that I can get something useful from the output of the `strings`command. Scrapping trough the output I found a particular string `picklecucumberl337`. I also used `floss easy_crackme_1 --format sc64` to see if I could get the same output but on the Windows VM. And they were the same. After running the file with the string I found it turns out is the correct key.
