# Dynamic Analysis
On this week's report, we will perform dynamic analysis of a RAT, a Remote Access Trojan. We will analyze its behavior to quickly identify indicators
of compromise that could be used to detect this malware in the wild. The The RAT we will be looking at will come from the ZOO library used in assignment 2.
It is called NjRAT. Watch out that there is a Win32.NjRAT version and a plain NjRAT version. We will use the latter.
